# Overview
This project is designed to provide a data dashboard displaying several chart types based on selected input by the user. Using a simple index page supported by JavaScript files is the main idea. 

# Summary

The index page came out clean with a horizontal bar chart, guage chart and bubble chart. The data can easily be evaluated using these charts.
